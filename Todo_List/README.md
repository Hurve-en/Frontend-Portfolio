# Todo List — Simple & Aesthetic

A small, high-school–themed todo list app (HTML / CSS / JS) with a clean notebook/card aesthetic, subject/priority badges, and a presentation mode.

This project is intentionally small, dependency-free, and easy to customize. The UI is defined in `todolist.css`, markup in the HTML file you provided, and logic in `todolist.js`.

---

## Contents

- `index.html` — markup, templates, and asset references.
- `todolist.css` — styles (school / chalkboard look, responsive, present mode).
- `todolist.js` — app logic (rendering, add/edit/remove, filters, sort, present mode).
- `assets/` — (optional) images, icons, resume, etc.

---

## Quick start

1. Place `index.html`, `todolist.css`, and `todolist.js` in one folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or serve with a static server).

Optional: for local development, run a simple server:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
